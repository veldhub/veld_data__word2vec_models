# veld_data__word2vec_models

This repo contains data velds encapsulating static wordembeddings models trained on AMC at 
https://github.com/veldhub/veld_chain__train_infer_wordembeddings_multiple_architectures__amc/

This public repo does not contain the models themselves but only the metadata, due to licensing and
storage issues. Best performing models will be published on other platforms once acceptable
performance is achieved.

See inside the various data veld yaml files for information on each model.
